## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The challenge

Your challenge is to integrate with the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to pull country data and display it like in the designs.

You can use any JavaScript framework/library on the front-end such as [React](https://reactjs.org) or [Vue](https://vuejs.org). You also have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information on a separate page
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode _(optional)_

## Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS
- Axios HTTP Library

## What I learned

- Performing JS logic in JS template literals
- Custom routing
- CSS tricks like multiple class selectors
- Manipulating APIs

## Continued Development

The next time I want to implement this project by using

- React styled components, custom hooks and routers

## Useful resources

- [Multiple class selectors](https://css-tricks.com/multiple-class-id-selectors/) - This helped me in clarifying how to select multiple classes in the same element.
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me in the debugging process.
